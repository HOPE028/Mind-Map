              <h1>Faith</h1>
              <p>
                Faith is an unshakable belief that guides us through the unseen,
                the unknown and the unseen. Nomi had a hard time holding on to
                her faith as she watched her loved ones lose theirs. She fought
                a long and hard battle to keep her faith alive, but by the end
                of it, Nomi could no longer claim to be a faithful person.

                Hatred, anger, and sadness consumed Nomi's thoughts when she
                thought of the mouth. The mouth was one of the main factors that
                led to the downfall of her family, which was the most precious
                thing in the world to her.

                Ray was simple, straightforward, and caring, the perfect
                complement to Trudie, a complex individual. He was someone
                Trudie could rely on without reservation and have complete faith
                in. However, Ray had a hard time balancing his faith and his
                family, and in the end, he lost both. It was a difficult
                decision to make and ultimately caused him to lose both the most
                important things to him.

                For Nomi, life was uncomplicated when she had her family. She
                had a clear purpose and goal. Without her family, Nomi yearned
                for their return, so she could go back to how things were
                before. Her ultimate goal was to be reunited with her family in
                heaven, but the sad reality was that she will not have the happy
                reunion she had envisioned.

                left. Nomi knew that all along. All the times she was kicked out

              <h1>Freedom</h1>
              <p>
                In Nomi's town, the concept of freedom is foreign, it is
                believed that only the afterlife would give true freedom.
                Growing up, Nomi took this belief to heart, but as she grew
                older and her family was gone, she began to lose her adherence
                to it. With the loss of her family, many of the societal
                restrictions that had governed her life were lifted. She began
                to engage in activities that were forbidden by her town, and she
                did not care that they were against the law. She had nothing to
                lose.

              <h1>Shame</h1>
              <p>
                Shame was always closely tied to the church in Nomi's little
                town. It was something that was inflicted on individuals or
                families as a form of punishment, often in the form of shunning
                and excommunication. These actions had a profound and
                long-lasting impact on Nomi's family, as they struggled to cope
                with the shame, isolation and rejection imposed upon them. The
                result could be seen in the absence of Trudie and Tash, among
                other things, as they were forced to leave the community and
                their loved ones.
